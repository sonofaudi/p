      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a Frontend developer & 3D-art/Game Dev who loves turning My art into
        experiences. You'll find me sketching character concepts(as a hobby animator), recording a song (yeah i sing), writing my book titled 'Drenched', usually on my free time,
        or experimenting with WebXR, 3d virtual creation tools or taking notes of random Innovative Ideas

      <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
      <p>
        Web-pack tooling, advanced TypeScript generics, and production DevOps
        pipelines. I'm tackling these by building small projects and documenting
        each step.

      <h2>Note to Future Self</h2>
      <p>
        Keep the curiosity alive bro, every bug is a lesson as frustrating as it may seem. Ship early, refactor
        often, and never skip accessibility checks, yeah and Try using AI more or ask others for help you'll crash out one of these days.

        Umm i'm grateful for the supportive community and the chance to learn how to join both of my skills, merging art & code, to build or contribute in building a future, I might just leave the Trenches soon...I WILL LOCK IN.
